<-------------------------------------Assignment 0---------------------------------->



<---------question 1------->
//this is first code
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int i=5,j;
//printing the address of a variable
printf("%u",&i);
for(j=0;j<50;j++)
{
printf("%u",&j);
printf("\n");
}
return 0;
}

when we run code multiple terminal we will get the same address for both terminal.
when we run a loop  we get same address of the entire loop.

.....gcc -Wall pl.c -o






<-------question 2-------->
To print resource utilization statistics of processes just enter top command.
when we start a browser then process for crome gets bolder.
Whe we compile code it doesn't effect statistics of process.
More then 90% memory is free in  the system. when we start a process then memory use increases.
Crome using most of the cpu.
web browser 'crome' has maximum share of memory.







<---------------Question 3--------------------->
strace--trace system call and signals.
File access,program flow ,replay,statics 

1.strace -e open ls

2.true,false,shift   these commands does not make any system call.
  
strace bash::it tells all the information about bash uses the system call to read command from system call.


it also uses read command to write on console window.
